**Spatial Interpolation** extends station-level measurements into a **continuous pollution surface** across Delhi, filling the gaps between monitoring stations. 
It uses spatial correlations in the data to estimate PM₂.₅ values in unsampled areas.

### About TabNet

**TabNet** is a deep learning model for tabular data, also introduced by **Google Research**. It is especially useful for combining air quality data with external predictors like weather, traffic, and land use to improve forecasting accuracy.

- **Version used here:** [dreamquark-ai/tabnet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07442)
- **Input:** Station data of PM₂.₅ + other contextual features
- **Output:** Predicted PM₂.₅ values at both station and city scale
- **Why TabNet?**

  - **Interpretable predictions:** Attention masks show which features drive forecasts.
  - **High performance:** Outperforms many ML models (Random Forest, XGBoost) on structured data.
  - **Efficient feature learning:** Automatically selects the most relevant predictors at each step.
  - **Scalable:** Handles large, mixed-type datasets effectively.

TabNet strengthens forecasting by leveraging **multi-source contextual data** for more accurate and explainable predictions.
