### About TimesFM

**TimesFM** (Time Series Foundation Model) is a state-of-the-art forecasting model developed by **Google Research** for univariate time-series prediction. It is designed to generate accurate forecasts using only historical data (no retraining or fine-tuning required).

- **Version used here:** [google/timesfm-2.0-500m-pytorch](https://huggingface.co/google/timesfm-2.0-500m-pytorch)  
- **Input:** Past **336 hours (14 days)** of PM₂.₅ data per station  
- **Output:** Predicted **next 72 hours (3 days)** of PM₂.₅ values  
- **Why TimesFM?**  
  - **Zero-shot forecasting**: TimesFM can make predictions on new datasets without any additional training.
  - **Transformer-based architecture**: Built with hundreds of millions of parameters, it captures complex temporal patterns using deep learning.
  - **Massive training corpus**: Pretrained on over **100 billion time points**, enabling it to generalize across domains like weather, pollution, finance, and more.
  - **Long context windows**: Supports input sequences up to **512 time steps**, making it ideal for hourly or daily forecasting.
